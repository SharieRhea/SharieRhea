Hi there, I'm Sharie.
I love learning, programming, and anything that involves solving a puzzle.  

### On-going projects:  
  * TrackTagger | Python - [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/)  
    * A terminal user interface (TUI) program for editing song metadata. Uses last.fm to query and fetch data if desired.  
  * [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) | C++  
    * Attempting previous AoC challenges with a new language for each year.  

### Future Project Ideas:
  * Period Tracker App | Kotlin
    * A free, open-source, privacy focused, and highly customizable period-tracking app.

Thanks for stopping by ^^
