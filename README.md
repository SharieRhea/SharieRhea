Hi there, I'm Sharie Rhea! <br />
I am a college student interested in programming and simply looking to enjoy the process.<br />

### On-going projects:<br />
  * Overhaul Website | Angular<br />
    * My personal portfolio website. Currently very basic and in need of updating.
  * TrackTagger | Python<br />
    * A GUI program for editing .mp3 metadata. Uses last.fm to query and fetch data if desired.

### Future Project Ideas:<br />
  * Malicious QR Code Detector | Kotlin<br />
    * A mobile application that scans a QR code, determines if the destination URL is shortened, and provides the real URL. Optionally, a user may choose to check the URL with a service such as VirusTotal.  
  * Period Tracker App | Kotlin<br />
    * A free, open-source, privacy focused, and highly customizable period-tracking app.

Thanks for stopping by ^^
