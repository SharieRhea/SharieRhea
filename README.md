Hi there, I'm Sharie Rhea! <br />
I love learning, programming, and anything that involves solving a puzzle.

### On-going projects:<br />
  * TrackTagger | Python - Flet<br />
    * A cross-platform desktop GUI program for editing .mp3 metadata. Uses last.fm to query and fetch data if desired.
  * Malicious QR Code Detector | Kotlin Multiplatform<br />
    * A mobile application that scans a QR code, determines if the destination URL is shortened, and provides any and all redirects to the final URL. Optionally, a user may choose to check any URL with VirusTotal.

### Future Project Ideas:<br />
  * Period Tracker App | Kotlin<br />
    * A free, open-source, privacy focused, and highly customizable period-tracking app.
  * Revisit Previous Advent of Code Years | ???
    * It would be fun to try a different language for every year!

Thanks for stopping by ^^
