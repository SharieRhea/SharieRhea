Hi! I'm Sharie Rhea! <br />
I am a college student interested in programming and simply looking to enjoy the process.
I'm currently learning Java through my classes and know some self-taught Python. 
Looking into HTML/CSS at the moment so that I can build my website!<br />
Thanks for stopping by ^^
